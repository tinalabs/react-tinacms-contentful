# Using Contentful in TinaCMS Plugins
---

To use Contentful in [TinaCMS plugins](https://tina.io/docs/plugins/), you can either use the [`cms.api`](#cms-api) object, or the [react utility hooks](#react-utility-hooks).

## CMS API

Inside various plugins types you will be given access to the `cms` object. You can access the `ContentfulAPIClient` from this. For example, in a [content creator plugin])():

```
const PostCreatorPlugin = {
  __type: 'content-creator',
  fields: [
    { name: "fields.title", label: "Title", component: "text" }
  ],
  onSubmit: aysnc(values, cms) {
    try {
      await cms.api.contentful.createEntry(values.fields)

      cms.alerts.success("Created entry")
    }
    catch (error) {
      cms.alerts.error(error.message)
    }
```

## React Utility Hooks

There are a variety of React utility hooks for interacting with Contentful:

- `useContentful`: returns the `ContentfulAPIClient` instance
- `useContentfulDelivery`: returns an instance of the Contentful JS SDK to retreive drafts from the delivery API.
- `useContentfulPreview`: returns an instance of the Contentful JS SDK to retreive drafts from the preview API.
- `useContentfulPreview`: returns an instance of the Contentful JS SDK to retreive drafts from the preview API.
- `useContentfulManagement`: returns an instance of the Contentful Management API for the current logged in Contentful user.
  > **Note:** do not use this in contexts where the CMS is not enabled and a user is not logged in.
